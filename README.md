# Job-Poosting-Project

## Overview

In the dynamic landscape of the modern job market, the ability to harness and interpret vast amounts of data is important for making informed decisions. The "Data Analyst Job Posting" project emerges as a testament to the trans-formative power of data analysis in unraveling insights from a collection of information extracted from prominent job portals. Here data is extracted from Shine (one of the top job portals in India).Through careful data scraping techniques and advanced analytical tools, this project addresses the challenge of processing large datasets efficiently. By harnessing the power of data, we aim to unravel trends, patterns, and key indicators within the job market, empowering organizations to make informed decisions in their hiring strategies. This documentation will provide an in-depth exploration of the methods employed to collect, clean, and interpret the extensive data set, offering valuable insights into the present job posting landscape.


There are so many job portals like LinkedIn,Indeed,Glassdoor, Monster,SimplyHired and Shine etc. Here data is scrapped from Shine job portal. For accessing a site we need APIs (Application Programming Interface),and for getting it we need to pay a certain amount or subscribe it. APIs are provided by the companies itself. But for some sites, it’s not needed. Shine.com is one of the websites where API is not needed.

By analyzing  the data more jobs are offered in Karnataka and Maharashtra. So focusing on that location we can shortlist companies based on the experience required for the job and designation. Also there offers from specific locations (inside) of different States.

Some companies do not mention the work location of the job, instead mention as All India. This information can has two faces,which is the company is recruiting a person and assign him in required location where company’s sub-division is located. Another the job posting can be a scam. So before applying the job, check the company is legitimate or not.
